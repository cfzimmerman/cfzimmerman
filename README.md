This is my new personal website, replacing [this](https://bb-my-website.vercel.app/) Next project. The old site had more content and required more work to maintain. Also, it was a Next app, and the rate of deprecation / bitrot was painfully high. Learning from that, I opted for a much simpler setup using HTML, Tailwind, Parcel, and GitHub sites. I'd rather spend my time writing Rust anyway :)
